#Svn Slider#
A subversion file history browser written in c# similar to [svn-time-lapse-view](https://code.google.com/p/svn-time-lapse-view/) which seems to be abandoned.
This one uses [SharpSvn](http://sharpsvn.open.collab.net/) to read you repository and show you all the revisions for the chosen file
